# PC9-Treatment-Modeling
Repository to house code files for modeling treatment strategies for pc-9 non-small cell lung cancer cells based on cell cycle phase.

We ultimately wish to predict optimal combination treatment strategies for pc-9 lung cancer using two drugs: osimertinib (an EGFR inhibitor) and palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor). We hope to achieve this by testing the efficacy of various treatment plans using the model coded in these files. 

This project is designed by Zach Schlamowitz, working at the University of Arizona under the supervision of Andrew Paek, PhD.
